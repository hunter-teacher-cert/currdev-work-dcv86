What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
  - Intro to Computer Science, 9-12 graders, usually zero or minimal prior experience. 

What is the language?
- The language we covered was Snap!

How does one write & run code in this language?
- Snap! is an entirely block-based language modeled after Scratch.

Rate the complexity of the syntax.
- The syntax is more complex than Scratch, as you can create custom blocks, but it is otherwise straightforward. It is almost pseudocode.

Strengths
- Primary strength is its ease of use, especially for beginners. 

How would you utilize the strengths in the class?
- I would probably use it as a primer to a text-based language. 

Weaknesses
- It is outdated, and no autosave feature, and has little relevance in real-world coding applications. 

How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
- I'd probably reinforce basics repeatedly throughout the class, like saving and sharing, as the platform can sometimes spaz out and cause lost work.

Why did you select this language for this class?
- I chose this language because of how easy it is to learn and how visual the output is.
