Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:
# The name of the tool: 
- GoGuardian
# What its general purpose is: 
- GG is a monitoring app that allows teachers to view students screens in real time. It also alows you to block or allow certain websites. 
# The class(es) you use it in:
- All my courses- APCSP, 6th Grade Science, 8th Grade Musical Theater, (both sections of) intro to _Coding_.
# How you use it in class:
- They've recently added the feature of screencasting, so in additon to the 1:1 chatting and executive functiontioning guidance, I'm also able to present my screen directly onto students screens.
- 
# Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?
- if the students split their screen correctly, this is invaulabe for live coding scenarios as the student can very easily follow along on their own window. 


# The name of the tool 
- PopCode
# What its general purpose is.
- PopCode is a simple, WebDev ide that is focused on simplicity. 
# The class(es) you use it in.
- I use it in my intro to coding class (ICT -- but w/o second teacher)
# How you use it in class.
- I use it as a scaffold for students who struggle with some of the more complex IDEs. Replit is great, but there are a lot of buttons and screens and terms to learn. If a student has a disablity, PopCOde is a single screen that has better visual markers when there is an error (the screen turns red when there is a syntax error). It also has functionality to automatically clean up you code, which is useful for students with problems (physicial or otherwise) typing. 
# Why you have selected that tool for that purpose
- It's the best webdev ide i've found that isn't block based. Covers a lot of my needs.
