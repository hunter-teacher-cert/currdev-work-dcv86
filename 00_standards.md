Pick 2 specific NY CS standards, describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, and explain how.
You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both or different ones.


Standard:
Digital Literacy 
9-12.DL.1 - Type proficiently on a keyboard.

Assignment:
The educational trend of not teaching touch typing throughout middle and high school is doing a tremendous disservice to young people. I teach juniors and seniors that type, like my 75-year-old father, who never worked behind a desk or keyboard (or typewriter) a day in his life. I teach typing explicitly, which usually falls between units or when students have a half day, but I teach it. The assignment is generally having them work through an online typing course. Then, I have them compete against each other in a March Madness bracket-style competition based on WPM. The winner gets Pizza. If the student wants, they can challenge me in a head-to-head typing competition, best 4 out of 7, for a chance to win a party for their class.

Standard:
Digital Citizenship 
9-12.DL.7 - Design and implement strategies that support the safety and security of digital information, personal identity, property, and physical and mental health when operating in the digital world.


Assignment:
For this standard, I generally have my students (high school) examine and change their privacy settings on their email and social media accounts. Many students need to be made aware of the amount of control they have over the visibility of their social media accounts. I also have them audit their account passwords and show them how to implement strong, secure, memorable passwords.
