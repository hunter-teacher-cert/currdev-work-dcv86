## Assignment 1: 
For the first assignment, I was thinking about having the students play some retro video games -- SNES, Sega Genisis, etc. Students must select one video game to review. (I'm thinking about just loading ROMs and Emulators on some computers around the room.)

The students will play the role of Video Game Reviewers. 

For this role, the students will write about the elements they feel make the game enjoyable, being as specific as possible. Were the controls intuitive? Were the logistics of the game sound? How difficult was it? Etc. They're essentially identifying what literal elements make the game enjoyable. Students will submit their completed review sheet (one with possible sentence starters, guiding questions, and examples) of the game. Depending on availability and time, students may play the game for longer to get a better handle on it. 

## Assignment 2: 
The second assignment in this sequence is for the student who now takes the role of Video Game Designer! They must take a screen-grab of several distinct parts of the game they've played and reviewed and identify the specific details of the video game in their desired coding language. 

So, for example, they might identify the score as a Variable they'd need to create in their own video game. They also might place different sprites on the screen (the main character, background elements, obstacles, etc.). They must also identify the effects of interaction with the features on the screen. (If you get hit with a mushroom, Mario shrinks, etc.)

The rationale behind this is to wire-frame the multitude of elements happening to make the video game playable. I'm sure they'll be control elements to reflect on and design elements. Hopefully, they can take a few pieces and incorporate them into their retro video game project build.
