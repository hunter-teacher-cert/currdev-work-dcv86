The computer science department at my school starts and stops with me. I had no background in computer science before I started teaching the subject and no other teacher showed any interest in learning. So creating courses was and still is entirely up to me. And I have almost no feedback (before this coursework!) on the appropriate course subject matter and rigor. So, now that I have some upper-level computer science courses under my belt, I see just how lacking I am in the course materials and subject matter that students see in their collegiate continutation of CS.

My idea for a course is two-fold. Offer a class with a level of complexity that honestly represents the complexity of a college-level computer science class. And offer coursework for students who want to be in a computer science class. At my school, students are randomly assigned either my Intro to CS course (which my Administration programmed as "Coding") or AP CSP.

In a perfect world, there would be more than one teacher, and the courses would connect -- expanding on the previous years' course knowledge and allowing students to gain a deep, functional understanding of a language. So more than a specific class (-- if you went by my program over the years, I think I've "taught" just about every CS course offered at a college) -- I would create a CS track and the ability for students to choose to be in that track, and a profound exploration at a high level when in the path -- whatever the language might be.
